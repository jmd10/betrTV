TO-DO...

everything checks out except when I try to runserver, it tells me there is no
module named "sources". Not sure what the fuck is up with that. Can either find
the issue, or just move the code over from 'sources' to 'views', but this seems
like something I should know how to do. 


- determine method for keeping the admin folder somewhere inaccessible to others

- identified and got coding for 10 Impact Theory videos
