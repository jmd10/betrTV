TO-DO...
- start at chapter 19, "User accounts".
  - go through to understand, even if it doesn't seem directly applicable. I
    need to learn and understand the uses of the models. That is the key to the
    next evolution of this product such that I can use a database to store users'
    preferences and simply to better understand so I can build future django apps.
    
- determine method for keeping the admin folder somewhere inaccessible to others
