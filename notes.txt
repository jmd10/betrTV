TO-DO...

1. next step is to clean up that file by using the 'sources.py' module. This is
  something I need to learn and understand and get to work (though, 'need' is a
  strong word) (learning lesson... modules)

2. scrape the web for videos, create a files with all of them.

3. change the system such that a random number between 0 and the len of the list
    each day, and that choses the video.

4. play with the cursor control to autoplay the video as soon as someone opens
    the website.



- determine method for keeping the admin folder somewhere inaccessible to others
