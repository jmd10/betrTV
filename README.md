The aim of betr.tv is to take videos on the web (youtube, vimeo, et... ) and
collect them in one place.

These videos are videos such as Impact Theory, Mindvalley, Jay Shetty, Tim Ferris,
etc... videos that empower and inform. It is intended to be stripped of all of the
banal shit that is out there. All of the popular platforms are dragged to the
lowest common denominator. This is intended to be a place people can go to not have
to endure the barrage of shit they get eslewhere. Instead they will be exposed to
empowering content.

The vision is that it is a bit of a return to television. That when it is turned on
a video is playing. When you open it it is opened in the middle of whatever is playing
and if you want something else you can choose other videos. Over time, people will be
able to choose preferences, algorithms can make suggestions based upon what people
like, etc...

However, you open it, there is a list of categories or shows on the left, the
video screen in the middle, and a list of other videos on the right (similar to
youtube) with comments and conversations below.
